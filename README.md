#Exploritary Data Analysis
   Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of examining, cleaning, and summarizing data to gain a deeper understanding of it. It is a crucial step in any data science or machine learning project, as it helps to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.There are two main types of EDA: graphical and non-graphical. Graphical EDA involves using data visualization techniques to visualize the data, while non-graphical EDA involves using statistical methods to summarize the data.
Some steps involved in EDA
Data Preprocess:
1. Import Python Libraries:
           The first step is to import the necessary Python libraries for data analysis. These libraries may include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
2. Reading Dataset:
      Read the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. This will allow you to easily manipulate and analyze the data.
3. Data Reduction:
     If the dataset is large, you may need to reduce the size of the data before performing EDA. This can be done by sampling the data or using dimensionality reduction techniques.
4. Impute Missing values:
     If there are missing values in the data, you may need to impute them. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as mean imputation or median imputation.

Data Cleaning:

5. Removing missing values: 
        Missing values can be removed by either dropping the rows or columns with missing values, or by imputing the missing values with a reasonable estimate.
6. Handling duplicate values:
        Duplicate data is a common problem in data analysis. It can occur for a variety of reasons, such as data entry errors, data duplication during data collection, or data merging errors. Duplicate data can lead to a number of problems, such as inaccurate results, inefficient data processing, and biased models. Duplicate values can be removed by dropping the duplicate rows or columns, or by merging the duplicate rows or columns.
7. Correcting data types: 
        Data types can be corrected by converting the data to the appropriate type, such as converting strings to numbers or numbers to strings.
8.Formatting data: 
        Data can be formatted by converting the data to a consistent format, such as converting all dates to the same format or all numbers to the same format.

EDA Exploratory Data Analysis:
  Now you can start performing EDA. This may involve calculating descriptive statistics, visualizing the data, and identifying relationships between variables.

Statistics Summary:
 Calculate descriptive statistics for each variable in the dataset. This will give you a basic understanding of the data.

EDA Univariate Analysis:
   Univariate analysis is the process of analyzing a single variable at a time. This may involve plotting histograms, box plots, and density plots.
Conclusion:
   Once you have completed EDA, you will have a better understanding of the data. This will help you to build a more accurate machine learning model.
