#Exploritary Data Analysis
   Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of examining, cleaning, and summarizing data to gain a deeper understanding of it. It is a crucial step in any data science or machine learning project, as it helps to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.There are two main types of EDA: graphical and non-graphical. Graphical EDA involves using data visualization techniques to visualize the data, while non-graphical EDA involves using statistical methods to summarize the data.
Some steps involved in EDA

1. Import Python Libraries:
           The first step is to import the necessary Python libraries for data analysis. These libraries may include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
2. Reading Dataset:
      Read the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. This will allow you to easily manipulate and analyze the data.
3.Data Reduction:
     If the dataset is large, you may need to reduce the size of the data before performing EDA. This can be done by sampling the data or using dimensionality reduction techniques.
4.Impute Missing values:
     If there are missing values in the data, you may need to impute them. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as mean imputation or median imputation.
